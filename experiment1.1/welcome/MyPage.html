            <p>There are 3 stages of equal duration in this experiment. <em>Each stage has 5 rounds of 90 seconds each </em> and
                the same slider task. The stages are independent of each other. You will be given further instructions
                for each stage.</p>

            <p><em>Your payment will be determined by your performance in one randomly chosen stage. </em> This will be chosen by
                the computer at the end of the experiment and you will be informed about it then.</p>

            <p>Please remain silent throughout the experiment and do not communicate with other participants. If you
                have questions, please raise you hand and the experimenter will come over to you.</p>
