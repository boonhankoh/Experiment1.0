    <p>
        For each round, your screen will show 48 randomly positioned sliders. To correctly
        complete a slider, it must be moved <em>exactly to the center marked by a red dot. The slider will turn green
        when correctly completed.</em>
        The screen will show you the timer and a progress bar indicating how many sliders you have completed. The next
        round will begin automatically after 90 seconds with a new set of sliders.
    </p>

    <p>
        You must move <em>as many sliders to the center as you can</em>. Sliders completed in all rounds will be counted.
